ScalaR is a Scala implementation of R environment.

The goal of the project is to create an extensible pure-Scala
implementation of the R language for distributed statistical
computing in the JVM.

Since it is rather new many things are to be done.

Things that are already supported:
 - own R language parser and interpreter
 - primitive type vectors and operations on them, lists
 - a mechanism to write and wrap your own functions
 - some "base" functions are already implemented
 - simple console from the r-cloud project (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/rcloud/)
 - simple accessible object model for R environment

Missing:
 - complete R base and math functions implementations
 - S3 / S4 objects support for OOP
 - graphics
 - matrix operations, dataframes
 - help (as it is in current R environment)
 - bridge to C (for native calls)
